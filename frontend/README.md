# React Application Setup Guide

This frontend project was initialized using **Create React App**, a standard tool that provides a preconfigured environment for building React applications efficiently.

---

## Project Scripts

Within the project folder, the following npm commands are available:

---

### ▶ `npm start`

Starts the application in **development mode**.

* The app runs locally at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
* Any changes in the source code will automatically refresh the browser
* Warnings and linting messages will be shown in the console

---

### 🧪 `npm test`

Executes the test runner in **interactive watch mode**.

* Useful for continuous testing during development
* Tests automatically re-run when files are modified

Refer to the official documentation for more details on test execution.

---

### 📦 `npm run build`

Generates an **optimized production build**.

* Output files are placed inside the `build/` directory
* Code is minified and optimized for performance
* Asset filenames include hashes to improve caching

After completion, the project is ready for deployment.

---

### ⚠ `npm run eject`

> **Important:** This is a permanent action and cannot be undone.

* Removes the default abstraction layer
* Exposes all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.)
* Allows complete customization of the build process

This step is optional and generally unnecessary for small to medium-scale applications.
